# News Summaries

## About
The purpose of this project is to learn about both abstractive and extractive text summarization using NLP and deep learning.

## Extractive
This algorithim can be found in `extractive.py`. This algorithim works by ranking sentences based off importance and then compiles the top 50% of them.

## Abstractive
This algorithim will be able to be found in `abstractive.py`. Planning to test this approach using thie kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news. This will save some time initially while building and testing the model.
